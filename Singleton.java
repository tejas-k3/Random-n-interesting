/*
Synchronization adds some overhead, as it involves acquiring and 
releasing locks, which can impact performance. It is useful when
multiple threads need to access shared resources in a coordinated
manner to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. It
is essential for ensuring thread safety, but it's important to avoid
excessive synchronization, as it can lead to contention and performance
degradation. It is taken care at thread level, managed by the JVM.
